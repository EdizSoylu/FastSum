Fast Recall

This program is meant to ease the process of writing short notes with just enough information to recall the rest and if needed, return to find the original source faster by marking it on the PDFâ€™s page.

From the menu bar you can open PDF files and extract text by simply drawing a square over the text.
Press return on the text box on the note to save changes on the text

Just executing the app.py file should be enough to run it.

The Notes file is for saved notes.

The PDFs file is for PDF documents that are meant to be taken snippets from.

There is an example pdf and note that can be opened from toolbar

UPDATE: 

~~Save feature fixed.~~ Turns out it's not

Changed the name since it was really misleading, program does not summarize anything.

Added more comments.

Got rid of joke function(Converter).


uploading updated version on a separate file since it's after project deadline
