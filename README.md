Fast Summary

This program is meant to ease the process of writing short notes with just enough information to recall the rest and if needed, return to find the original source faster by marking it on the PDFâ€™s page.

This zombie of a project is the result of underestimating the necessary skills and unforeseen bugs and development mistakes that required rewriting some parts from the ground up to stay away from AI as much as possible. However I added a Fahrenheit-to-Celsius converter so hopefully it should compensate.(haha)

From the menu bar you can open PDF files and extract text by simply drawing a square around the text.

Just executing the app.py file should be enough to run it.

The Notes file is for saved notes but sadly it broke at some point and I have no idea why.

The PDFs file is for PDF documents that are meant to be summarized.
